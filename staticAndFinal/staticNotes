Sta$c Members
• Static	Keyword	is	used	for	representing	Meta	Data	(data	about	data).
• It	is	useful	for	representing	the	information	of	a	class.
• Static	members	belongs	to	a	class	and	they	can	be	shared	by	all	the
objects	of	the	class	and	all	the	objects	have	their	own	non-static
members	.
• All	the	object	can	use	the	static	variable	as	a	shared	data.
• Static	members	can	be	accessed	just	by	using	class	name.
• The	static	members	of	a	class	are	created	in	the	method	area.
• Static	methods	can	access	only	static	members.
Example	Program
• From	the	given	example	the	“price=10”	is	the	meta	data	of	the	class
HondaCity.
class HondaCity
{
 static long price=10;
 int a,b;
 static double OnRoadPrice(String city)
 {
 Switch(city)
 {
 Case “Delhi”:
 return price+price*0.1;
 case “Mumbai”:
 return price+price*0.09;
 }
 }
}
class test
{
 public static void main()
 {
 Sta$c Blocks
 • Set	of	statements	are	written	in	the	form	of	blocks	and	are	made
 static.
 • It	is	used	to	initialise	static	data	member.
 • It	is	executed	before	the	main	method	at	the	time	of	class	sloading.
 ➢ Final Members
 • Values	of	Linal	variables	are	Lixed,	once	the	value	is	assigned	then	it
 can’t	be	modiLied.
 • Final	variables	are	written	in	capital	letters.
 • Final	variable	can	be	initialised	while	declaring	the	variable,	or	it	can
 be	initialised	in	a	static	block,	or	else	it	can	be	initialised	inside
 constructor	of	a	class.
 • As	constructors	can	be	overloaded	then	the	Linal	variable	must	be
 initialised	in	every	constructor.
 • Final	method	cannot	be	overridden.
 • A	Linal	class	cannot	be	extended.
 Example	Program
 ➢
 class My
 {
  final int MIN=1;
  final int NORMAL;
  final int MAX;

  static
  {
  NORMAL=5;
  }
  My()
  {
  MAX=10;
  }
 }
  Singleton Class
  • A	class	which	can	create	only	one	object	is	called	singleton	class.
  Constructors	are	made	private	to	and	object	of	the	singleton	class	is
  written	in	static	method.
  • In	singleton	class	getInstance()	method	is	used
