One-Dimensional ARRAY:
➢ Array	is	a	collection	of	similar	data	elements.
➢ In	java	the	array	size	is	given	after	creating	the	new	object.
As			int	A[]=	new	int[x];
Where	A[]	is	the	reference	and	int[x]	is	the	object.
Where	object	is	created	in	the	heap.
And	the	reference	is	either	in	stack	or	heap.
➢ Location	of	characters	in	array	can	be	accessed	by	using	their	index.
➢ Every	array	in	java	has	length	as	its	property	which	can	be	accessed
by	using	“array-name.length”.
➢ For	loops	are	most	frequently	used	for	arrays.
➢ Using	for	loop	all	the	elements	in	the	arrays	can	be	accessed/
elements	in	array	can	be	transveresed	using	arrays.
➢ Java	has	introduced	for	each	loop	for	accessing	arrays	in	version	java
1.5	or	java	5.
➢ For	each	loop:	syntax						for(type	var	:	array)
				{
Statements	using	var;
	}

Example	program:
class test
{
 public static void main(String args[])
 {
 int A[]={2,4,6,8,10}
 for(int i=0;i<A.length;i++)
 {
 System.out.println(A[i]);
 }
 for(int i=A.length-1;i>=0;i--)
 {
 System.out.println(A[i]);
 }
 }
}

Two-Dimensional ARRAY:
➢ Two-dimensional	array	are	suitable	for	matrices	and	tabular	form.
➢ Syntax	for	creating	two-dimensional	array	in	java	is
:	int	A[][]	=	new	int	[3][4].
➢ It	is	also	known	as	array	of	arrays	or	collection	of	arrays
➢ Object	is	created	In	heap	but	the	reference	may	or	may	not	be	created
in	heap.
➢ Array_name.length	gives	number	of	rows.
➢ Array_name[index].length	gives	the	number	of	columns.
Example	program:
class test
{
 public static void main(String args[])
 {
 int A[][];
 for(int i=0;i<A.length;i++)
 {
 for(int j=0;j<A[0].length;j++)
 {
 System.out.println(A[i][j]);
 }
 System.out.println(“\n”);
 }
 }
}

➢ In	for	each	loop	the	array	have	no	integer	elements	but	the	reference
elements.
➢ Syntax	of	for	each	loop	for	two	dimensional	array:
for(type	var	:array)
{
for(type	var1	:type	var)
 {
 Statements	using
var(type	var	1);
}
}
Example:
class test:
{
 public static void main(String args[])
 {
 int A[];
 for(int x[]:A)
 {
 for(int y:x)
 {
 System.out.println(y);
 }
 System.out.println(“\n”);
 }
 }
}

Jagged	array	is	a	type	of	array	in	which	the	members	are	of	different
sizes.
➢ In	jagged	array	the	members	of	arrays	are	created	separately
according	to	their	sizes	using	their	indices.
